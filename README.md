# Language Models - NLP Project 

Implementation of an RNN-based language modeling system. 

Experiments:
- Investigate the performance using LSTM vs. GRU
- Investigate the performance using various word embeddings: Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText.
- If possible (you might end up having an extremely large number of parameters), include
attention in your model. As inspiration, see Salton et al.
(https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/I17-1045/). Investigate
